# CITCON Europe 2019 in Ghent

This is intended to help participants of [CITCON Europe 2019](https://citconf.com/ghent2019/) to organise their travel to Ghent.

I got several requests on Twitter to recommend accommodations in Ghent. Living myself in Ghent, and never having to book a hotel in Ghent, it was a bit difficult to come up with a list. The best thing I could imagine of was to go to the local bookstore and grab a copy of the Lonely Planet and Guide du Routard for Belgium.

## Where to eat

### Specialities

Ghent/Flanders/Belgium has some food specialities.

Specialities of Ghent:

- [Gentse Waterzooi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterzooi): a stew dish of chicken and potatoes.
- [Cuperdons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuberdon): a candy made with Arabic gum candy crust with a soft raspberry-flavoured inside filling. In Dutch it is called "neuzekes" or little noses.

Specialities of Flanders:

- [Flamish Carbonade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonade_flamande): a stew of beef (or porc) with beer (obviously) that takes hours to prepare. In Dutch it is called "stoverij".
- [Mastel](https://visit.gent.be/en/mastel): looks like a bagel made of flour, milk, butter, sugar and cinnamon. Difficult to find. It used to be available in all bakeries. The best way to eat them is ironed (with a toaster) with butter and brown sugar inside.

Specialities of Belgium:

- Chocolate (obviously), aspecially dark, and [pralines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praline)
- [Waffles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffle)
- Beer (obviously)

Where to have Waterzooi?

- ['t Vosken](https://www.tvosken.be/en/) at St-Baafsplein in between the Belfry and Sint-Baafs Cathedral.
- [Fait Divers](http://faits-divers.be/) at Korenmarkt. I once eaten Waterzooi there, 10 years ago. It was really good. But I see the reviews online are not that great. In addition, Korenmarkt is a tourist trap.

Where to have Flamish Carbonade?

- [De Abt](https://www.deabt.gent/). They make it with [Orval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orval_Brewery) beer. The story says Orval finds his origins at this place. They also serve aged Orval, which is difficult to find.
- Probably ['t Vosken](https://www.tvosken.be/en/) serves this too. As they serve all the typical regional dishes.

Where to find Cuperdons?

- [Groot Vleeshuis](https://www.grootvleeshuis.be/en/2136-2/) or Butcher's Hall at Groentenmarkt: you find all the regional products here and it is also a restaurant.
- On Groentenmarkt there are two stalls.
- [Confisserie Temmerman](https://visit.gent.be/en/see-do/confiserie-temmerman) at Kraanlei: a small authentic candy store having not the usual cone-shaped cuperdons. The woman has all the regional sweets: candy and cookies.

Where to find Mastels?

- [Bakery Himschoot](http://www.bakkerijhimschoot.be/gent-2) at Groentenmarkt. They also have the cuperdons.
- [Julie's House](https://www.julieshouse.be/en) at Kraanlei: fantastic place to have breakfast. In the weekend you have to reserve. They serve the ironed mastel with brown sugar.

Where to find Waffles?

Lot's of places where you can buy them on the street.

- [Etablissement Max](http://www.etablissementmax.be/) at Goudenleeuwplein next to the [City Pavilion](https://visit.gent.be/en/see-do/city-pavilion): the place to be, at 4PM they are full.

Where to find Chocolates?

- Fou de Chocolat at Kouter: little shop next to the Delhaize where you can buy all flavours of chocolate (lots of dark).
- Notenboetiek Salon Magelein at Mageleinstraat: the other store of Fou de Chocolat selling all sorts of nuts in combination with chocolat. You find here [mendiants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendiant) and coffee beans coated with dark chocolat.

Where to find Pralines?

- [Chocolaterie Van Hoorebeke](http://www.chocolatesvanhoorebeke.be/) at Sint-Baafsplein
- [Chocolaterie Van Hecke](http://www.chocolaterievanhecke.be/magic/chocolates.html) at Koestraat
- [Daskalides](http://daskalides.be/) at Henegauwenstraat: a Ghent family from Greek origin.
- [Neuhaus](https://www.neuhauschocolates.com/en/about-us/find-a-neuhaus-boutique/neuhaus-gent-koestraat/) at Koestraat: inventor of pralines, rather expensive.

## Accomodations

The [site of the The Lonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/belgium/flanders/ghent/hotels/best-places-to-stay-in-ghent?filters%5Bproperty_type_group%5D%5Bbudget_hotel%5D=true) references lots of hotels in Ghent of different categories.

The congress organisation service of the city of Ghent gave me these additional links:

### [Hotel Flandria](http://www.hotelflandria-gent.be/), Barrestraat 3

Budget Hotel

shared/private bathroom incl. breakfast from 58/70.

Near historic city centre.

Hidden in a little street surrounded by canals and stunning cathedrals.

It is located in the heart of Ghent, a few steps away from the most important attractions and the best places to taste the famous Belgian beer and enjoy the beautiful lights of the city.

It is one of the few hotels in Ghent city centre in a quiet neighbourhood and, at the same time, it is close to the vibrant spots of the city.

### [Big Sleep](http://www.bigsleep.be/), Hagelandkaai 38

B&B

single/double from 65/90 EUR.

Near [Portus Ganda](https://visit.gent.be/en/see-do/portus-ganda).

The three guestrooms of this friendly B&B in an attractive 1890s townhouse have high ceilings and private showers but shared toilets. The house is decorated with souvenirs of its owners' world travels, but perhaps its most notable features are that it is smoker friendly and has an attractive heated outdoor pool (summer months only). Handy for [Gent-Dampoort station](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/pois/1292361).

source: The Lonely Planet

### [Onderland](http://onderland.be/logies_algemeen_en.html), Rabotstraat 62

single/double incl. breakfast from 65/78 EUR.

A bit far away from the venue. A bit off the city centre.

In this 19th-century building with a fairly sleek facade you will find on the ground floor a very large suite (ideal for families) with a high ceiling, lots of wood and shutters. At the rear of the house two more modern attic rooms (for two people; the stairs are a bit steep). Nice inner garden (with the rabbit as mascot) where you can have breakfast in the summer. Very nice atmosphere.

### [Atlas B&B](https://www.atlas.gent/), Rabotstraat 40

B&B

single/double incl. breakfast from 74/84 EUR.

A bit far away from the venue. A bit off the city centre.

B&B

incl. breakfast from 85 EUR.

In between the [Sint-Baafs Cathedral](https://visit.gent.be/en/see-do/st-bavos-cathedral-majestic-tower) and [Portus Ganda](https://visit.gent.be/en/see-do/portus-ganda).

The exterior looks like that of all other houses in this inconspicuous, cobblestone street, but the inside is completely different: very modern vibrant colors, old tile floor ... Three (totally different) rooms, one in 70s style. That room has a balcony that opens onto the courtyard (and you have a nice view of the cathedral). Very sympathetic reception.

source: Le Guide du Routard

### [Baeten's B&B](http://baetenbnbgent.be/index_EN.html), Burgstraat 11

B&B

single/double incl. breakfast from 80/95 EUR.

Close to [The Castle of Counts](https://visit.gent.be/en/see-do/castle-counts).

B&B

No payment cards. Bikes at your disposal.

A B&B with a rich history (cellar from the 13th century, inn in the 16th, then a printing company for 150 years and finally a parsonage). A 100% ecological address. Comfortable rooms, airy and colorful. The peculiar name means "come, go" in Hindi. At the weekend you can sometimes suffer from noise from the nightclub across the street.

source: Le Guide du Routard

### [The Boatel](https://www.theboatel.com), Voorhoutkaai 44

2-star hotel on a boat.

single/double incl. breakfast from 92/126 EUR

At [Portus Ganda](https://visit.gent.be/en/see-do/portus-ganda).

This canal boat has been rebuilt as a hotel and is located at only a minute’s walk from the centre of town with all its historical monuments, museums and shops.

Equipped with 5 charming and cosy rooms of which 3 are standard rooms and 2 luxurious. Each room is decorated in a unique and surprisingly different style with view over the river. Every morning a delicious continental breakfast is served.

*Not recommended by any travel guide. I've added this one because I'm intruiged ever since I live here since nine years and passing by each day.*

### [Simon Says](http://simon-says.be), Sluizeken 8

Guesthouse

incl. breakfast from 130 EUR.

**Top Pick by Lonely Planet.**

Near Patershol.

Get in quick to snap one of Simon and Christopher's two fashionably styled guest rooms located above their well-patronised, chilled-out coffee shop in a fabulous part of town.

You can't miss it: it's the brightly coloured art nouveau house on the corner.

Cheery hosts, excellent breakfast and strong organic coffee.

Not too far from the shopping street Veldstraat.

Housed in Ghent's spectacular twin-turreted former post office. The property's common areas, guestrooms and suites are dark and moody in a wonderful way, with elements of great design at every turn (though note the standard rooms are compact for the price). The hotel also offers fine dining and an ultra-atmospheric bar.
