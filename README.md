# Accommodations in Ghent during CITCON Europe 2019

This is intended to help participants of [CITCON Europe 2019](https://citconf.com/ghent2019/) in their search for accommodations in Ghent.

I got several requests on Twitter to recommend accommodations in Ghent. Living myself in Ghent, and never having to book a hotel in Ghent, it was a bit difficult to come up with a list. The best thing I could imagine of was to go to the local bookstore and grab a copy of the Lonely Planet and Guide du Routard for Belgium.

## Accomodations

The [site of the The Loonely Planet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/belgium/flanders/ghent/hotels/best-places-to-stay-in-ghent?filters%5Bproperty_type_group%5D%5Bbudget_hotel%5D=true) references lots of hotels in Ghent of different categories.

The congres organisation service of the city of Ghent gave me these additional links:

- [Overnight stay on Visit Ghent](https://visit.gent.be/en/overnight-stay) - The Tourism service of the city of Ghent
- [The Guild of Ghent's B&B](https://www.bedandbreakfast-gent.be/)
- [The "white pages" of Ghent Hotels](http://boek.gent-hotels.eu/) (powered by booking.com)

### [Hotel Flandria](http://www.hotelflandria-gent.be/), Barrestraat 3

Budget Hotel

shared/private bathroom incl. breakfast from 58/70.

Near historic city centre.

Hidden in a little street surrounded by canals and stunning cathedrals.

It is located in the heart of Ghent, a few steps away from the most important attractions and the best places to taste the famous Belgian beer and enjoy the beautiful lights of the city.

It is one of the few hotels in Ghent city centre in a quiet neighbourhood and, at the same time, it is close to the vibrant spots of the city.

### [Big Sleep](http://www.bigsleep.be/), Hagelandkaai 38

B&B

single/double from 65/90 EUR.

Near [Portus Ganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portus_Ganda).

The three guestrooms of this friendly B&B in an attractive 1890s townhouse have high ceilings and private showers but shared toilets. The house is decorated with souvenirs of its owners' world travels, but perhaps its most notable features are that it is smoker friendly and has an attractive heated outdoor pool (summer months only). Handy for [Gent-Dampoort station](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/pois/1292361).

### [Onderland](http://onderland.be/logies_algemeen_en.html), Rabotstraat 62

single/double incl. breakfast from 65/78 EUR.

A bit far away from the venue. A bit off the city centre.

In this 19th-century building with a fairly sleek facade you will find on the ground floor a very large suite (ideal for families) with a high ceiling, lots of wood and shutters. At the rear of the house two more modern attic rooms (for two people; the stairs are a bit steep). Nice inner garden (with the rabbit as mascot) where you can have breakfast in the summer. Very nice atmosphere.

### [Atlas B&B](https://www.atlas.gent/), Rabotstraat 40

B&B

single/double incl. breakfast from 74/84 EUR.

A bit far away from the venue. A bit off the city centre.

This 1863 townhouse has attractive belle époque, art deco and art nouveau touches, a comfortable communal lounge area featuring maps, globes and an honesty bar, and four distinctive guest rooms themed by continent.

### [Alphabed](http://alphabed.be/eng/index.html), Jan Palfijnstraat 26

B&B

incl. breakfast from 85 EUR.

In between the [Sint-Baafs Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Bavo%27s_Cathedral,_Ghent) and [Portus Ganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portus_Ganda).

The exterior looks like that of all other houses in this inconspicuous, cobblestone street, but the inside is completely different: very modern vibrant colors, old tile floor ... Three (totally different) rooms, one in 70s style. That room has a balcony that opens onto the courtyard (and you have a nice view of the cathedral). Very sympathetic reception.

### [Baeten's B&B](http://baetenbnbgent.be/index_EN.html), Burgstraat 11

B&B

single/double incl. breakfast from 80/95 EUR.

Close to [Gravensteen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravensteen).

Behind a flea market (full of stuff from the 1950s) operated by Stefan. There are two quiet and tidy rooms in the back house. The cheaper room is slightly better, but the other room has a bathroom with an old-fashioned bathtub.

### [Aanaajaanaa](http://www.aanaajaanaa.be/?lang=en), Hoogpoort 25

B&B

single/double incl. breakfast from 90/110. Discount possible for stays longer than 5 days.

No payment cards. Bikes at your disposal.

A B&B with a rich history (cellar from the 13th century, inn in the 16th, then a printing company for 150 years and finally a parsonage). A 100% ecological address. Comfortable rooms, airy and colorful. The peculiar name means "come, go" in Hindi. At the weekend you can sometimes suffer from noise from the nightclub across the street.

### [The Boatel](https://www.theboatel.com), Voorhoutkaai 44

2-star hotel on a boat.

single/double incl. breakfast from 92/126 EUR

At [Portus Ganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portus_Ganda).

This canal boat has been rebuilt as a hotel and is located at only a minute’s walk from the centre of town with all its historical monuments, museums and shops.

Equipped with 5 charming and cosy rooms of which 3 are standard rooms and 2 luxurious. Each room is decorated in a unique and surprisingly different style with view over the river. Every morning a delicious continental breakfast is served.

*Not recommended by any travel guide. I've added this one because I'm intruiged ever since I live here since nine years and passing by each day.*

### [Simon Says](http://simon-says.be), Sluizeken 8

Guesthouse

incl. breakfast from 130 EUR.

**Top Pick by Lonely Planet.**

Near Patershol.

Get in quick to snap one of Simon and Christopher's two fashionably styled guest rooms located above their well-patronised, chilled-out coffee shop in a fabulous part of town.

You can't miss it: it's the brightly coloured art nouveau house on the corner.

Cheery hosts, excellent breakfast and strong organic coffee.

### [B&B Engelen aan de Waterkant](http://www.engelenaandewaterkant.be/), Ter Platen 30

B&B

from 110 EUR.

**Top Pick by Lonely Planet.**

Close to the venue.

Owned by an interior designer, this B&B – set in a 1900 townhouse overlooking a tree-lined canal – has a special atmosphere and two 'angel' rooms.

### [Ibis Gent Centrum Sint-Baafs Kathedraal Hotel](https://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-0961-ibis-gent-centrum-st-baafs-kathedraal/index.shtml), Limburgstraat 2

Hotel

from 113 EUR.

In between the [Sint-Baafs Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Bavo%27s_Cathedral,_Ghent) and the [Belfry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfry_of_Ghent).

Not your usual Ibis. The outside architecture is well adapted to the historical center.

*Not recommended by any travel guide. Just my addition.*

### [Ghent River Hotel](http://ghent-river-hotel.be), Waaistraat 5

Hotel

from 115 EUR.

Bereikbaar via het water! Deze oude katoenspinnerij, later opslagplaats, is nu een degelijk hotel. 77 kamers, uitstekend comfort.

### [Hotel Harmony](http://hotel-harmony.be), Kraanlei 37

Hotel

from 144 EUR.

Bicycle rental.

Patershol is located behind the hotel.

Nice modern hotel that has remained cozy and simple and that pays attention to ecology. The most expensive rooms have jacuzi and a terrace, even overlooking the canal. There is even a rooftop swimming pool. Delicious breakfast buffet.

### [B&B Hotel Verhaegen](http://www.hotelverhaegen.com/), Oude Houtlei 110

B&B

double/suite 210/264 EUR.

Not too far from commercial street.

This sumptuous 1770s urban palace retains original sections of 18th-century Chinese wallpaper, a dining room with romantic Austrian-era murals, a dazzling salon and a neatly manicured parterre garden. The five guest rooms combine well-placed modernist and retro touches. The lavish ‘Paola’s Room’ is named for the young Italian princess who stayed here long before becoming Belgium’s (now former) queen.

### [1898 The Post](http://www.zannierhotels.com/1898thepost/en/), Graslei 16

Hotel

incl. breakfast from 235 EUR.

In the middle of the historic city centre. At beautyfull [Graslei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graslei). The other side of the Korenlei.

Housed in Ghent's spectacular twin-turreted former post office. The property's common areas, guestrooms and suites are dark and moody in a wonderful way, with elements of great design at every turn (though note the standard rooms are compact for the price). The hotel also offers fine dining and an ultra-atmospheric bar.

### [Ghent Marriott](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/gnemc-ghent-marriott-hotel/), Korenlei 10

Hotel

incl. breakfast from 224 EUR.

In the middle of the historic city centre. At beautyfull [Korenlei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korenlei). The otherside of the Graslei.

On the inside Ghent's Marriott is a standard international business/tourist hotel with stylish (if somewhat generic), comfortable, modern rooms and a glass and steel atrium. On the outside its handsome facade incorporates four mediaval stone housefronts. Canal-view rooms (50 EUR extra) have wistful waterfront panoramas. Look online for some good deals.
